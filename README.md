# Spring_Boot_Courework

This repository contains the projects and code created during my learning journey in the "Master Spring Boot 3 & Spring Framework 6 with Java" course. The coursework covers various topics, ranging from fundamental Spring Boot concepts to advanced features such as Spring Security, AOP, OAuth, and containerization with Docker.

In addition to exploring Spring Boot, we implemented a Todo Application with spring boot, restful-api-services, H2 In-memory Database, SQL Database, Docker, Kubernetes and also, tested cloud deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS S3.

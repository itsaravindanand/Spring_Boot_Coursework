# Spring Boot Coursework

This repository contains the projects and code created during my learning journey in the "Master Spring Boot 3 & Spring Framework 6 with Java" course. The coursework covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental Spring Boot concepts to advanced features like Spring Security, AOP, OAuth, and containerization with Docker.

In addition to learning Spring Boot, we implemented a **Todo Application** that integrates Spring Boot with RESTful APIs, H2 in-memory database, MySQL database, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS S3.
